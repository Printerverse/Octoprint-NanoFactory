# Octoprint-Nanofactory

NanoFactory is a versatile and comprehensive plugin that enhances the functionality of your 3D printer by integrating seamlessly with OctoPrint, the popular open-source software for controlling and monitoring 3D printers.

This plugin offers a wide range of features that make 3D printing more efficient, user-friendly, and customizable. Here are some of the key features:

1. **Assisted Bed Leveling:** Manual or Probed, NanoFactory will assist you to achieve true level for every print job. This ensures that your prints adhere properly to the bed and are of high quality.

2. **Easy Unlimited Camera Stream:** Don't have a good camera? No problem, we got you covered. Mount any smartphone on your 3D Printer to use it as both a camera and a printer interface. Ofcourse, we also support octoprint default cameras and any other camera connected to your printer server.

3. **Customizable G-Code Scripts:** Automate your workflow through customized G-Code scripts. Add your own commands and functions, making it easier to customize your prints and automate certain tasks like replacing filament, clearing bed and moving printhead to a defined location.

4. **Multi-Printer Support:** The power of creation, in the palm of your hand. The plugin supports an infinite number of printers, allowing you to control and monitor multiple printers simultaneously and easily from a single unified web and mobile interface.

5. **Remote Monitoring:** You can remotely monitor your 3D prints from anywhere, using the NanoFactory web or mobile app. This allows you to keep track of your prints' progress and receive alerts when they are finished from anywhere in the world.

6. **Advanced Print Job Queuing:** Set it up once and watch go brrrrr. Schedule print jobs to start as soon as the previous one is finished and the bed is cleared. Great for printing a larger batch of parts in sequence. Enforce Bed Leveling, Filament Changes, and maintenance activites 

7. **Filament Usage Tracking:** Never run out of filament mid-print ever again! NanoFactory allows you to track the amount of filament used for each print, helping you to plan and optimize your filament usage. Automatically order a new spool such that it arrives as soon as you need it.

8. **Secure Multi-Device Connection:** Easily and securely share access to your printers and files with your team and your own devices for seamless collaboration. Whether it's your desktop, phone, smartwatch, a smart fridge or even your car, the NanoFactory App runs everywhere that has a web browser.The encryption on this bad boi is stronger than what they have on nukes.

Overall, NanoFactory is an indispensable tool for anyone who wants to get the most out of their 3D printer. Its extensive feature set and user-friendly interface make it a must-have for both beginners and experienced 3D printing enthusiasts.

# **Upcoming Features**

But wait, there's more! We've got some great upcoming features that'll blow your mind. Join today and be first in line to get access to advanced features like:

1. **Predictive Maintenance:** Don't be late to the party, fix problems before they happen. NanoFactory AI will be able to monitor your printer's performance and alert you to any potential issues before they become major problems. This will help you to keep your printer running smoothly and prevent downtime.

2. **Failure Detection and Prevention:** NanoFactory AI will be able to detect when a print has failed or is likely to fail, and will alert you to take corrective action. Based on the data from failures, it tries to figure out what went wrong and changes machine parameters for the next iteration. This will help you to avoid wasting time and materials on failed prints and shorten the product development cycle.

3. **Integrated Slicer:** WebSlicer, a port of CuraEngine integrated with NanoFactory, allows you to slice your 3D models directly within the NanoFactory App. This will save you time and make the printing process more streamlined.

4. **Workflow Integrations:** CAD integrations for direct job queuing from Fusion360, Community integrations for role-based access control and team notifications to Slack, Social Integrations for showing off your work to your twitter followers, 3D Model Repository integrations for start a print right from Thingiverse, Google Shopping Integration to market and sell your products directly from NanoFactory. We have so much more planned!
